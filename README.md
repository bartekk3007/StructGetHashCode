# StructGetHashCode
Program written to demonstrate how implementing and initialising struct by constructor works in C#. There is also implemented readonly struct which properties additionally don't have set accessors. Structs have also overloaded ToStirng and GetHashCode methods. In code there are also struct comparisons by instance method Equals.
